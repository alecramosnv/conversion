 <h1>The Beautiful Alberta Falls</h1>
 <hr />
 <div class="description">
  <p>Alberta Falls is one of the most spectacular waterfalls in Rocky Mountain National Park.</p>
  <p>It was given its name in the 1800s by Abner Sprague and his wife, who were two of the first people to live in the park.</p>
  <p>The waterfall can be reached by hiking just a half mile along a gentle uphill trail from the Glacier Gorge Trailhead.</p>
  <p>There are many beautiful lookouts along the trail. Come check it out!</p>
